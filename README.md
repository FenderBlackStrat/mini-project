## Steps:

1. I installed Docker Desktop and pulled PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.
2. In PyCharm IDE, I created project repo with the Flask application, HTML templates, and PostgreSQL database.
3. Added the necessary feature to filter the courses. Also, I applied some CSS styles for a better appearance.
4. Next, I containerized the app and created Docker network since PostgreSQL server was on another container.
5. Finally, I did some checkup to make sure that everything works correctly.
6. Created GitHub repository and uploaded all files.
